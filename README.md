Adventures in data

## [regimen_generator](https://github.com/mmcdaris77/Springer/tree/master/regimen_generator)
A configurable rules engine to build Lines OF Therapy from messy healthcare data.  This example uses purly synthetic OMOP data.  So the regimens are concept_ids rather than drug names for now ;) 

## [drug_ner](https://github.com/mmcdaris77/Springer/tree/master/drug_ner)
Is an example of NER for unstructured drug regimens.

## [npi_data](https://github.com/mmcdaris77/Springer/tree/master/npi_data)
Is an example of DBT and Dagster using SQLITE.
